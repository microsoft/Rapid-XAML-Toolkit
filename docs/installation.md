# Installation

There are two versions of the extension. We recommend using the release version unless you want to test something that is only in the beta version. While it is possible to have both versions installed at once, some functionality may not work correctly if both are enabled (Extensions > Manage Extensions) at the same time.

## Official Release

Get the toolkit from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlToolkit) or by searching inside Visual Studio.

_If you had it, the preview version should be uninstalled first._

## Beta builds

_Beta versions distributed via VSIX Gallery and MyGet are no longer available._

***

Once installed you can begin using the extension and should [start by configuring it for the way you work](./configuration.md).
